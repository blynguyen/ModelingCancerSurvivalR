â€¢	Models and plots the survival (probability of surviving beyond a specific time) and 
hazard rates (risk of dying in the next small time interval) and functions in patients with 
tongue cancer that possess aneuploid tumors. This project displays the ability to perform 
complex calculations in Rstudio, ability to import and manipulate both censored and uncensored 
data, as well as displaying the ability to generate graphs of fitted data.
